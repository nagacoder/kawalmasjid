## Tech Stack

Listed here are only the most important parts in the stack.Ô∏è Some setup mostly finished, but some might haven't done yet or still in progress. More details and references can also be checked from [`mhaidarhanif/rewinds`](https://rewinds.mhaidarhanif.com) and [`catamyst/stack`](https://a.catamyst.com/stack).

## Development

### Install Dependencies

Before running your Remix app locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed using your preferred package manager agent:

```sh
# this repo is using pnpm lock file
pnpm i
```

Or if using [`ni`](https://github.com/antfu/ni) which can autodetect the agent:

```sh
pnpm add -g @antfu/ni  # install once
ni                     # can auto choose npm/yarn/pnpm
```

### Setup Environment Variables/Secrets

Use plain `.env` file for local development:

```sh
cp -i .env.example .env
# -i or --interactive will ask before overwrite
```

Then edit `.env` as you need.

### Prisma ORM and Database Connection

This repo is suited to use either your own MySQL instance or MySQL on PlanetScale.

Once you have the database URL connection string, for example:

```sh
DATABASE_URL='mysql://username:pscale_pw_password@region.connect.psdb.cloud/name?sslaccept=strict'
```

If you need to use local database, run [Docker compose](./docker-compose.yml):

```sh
docker compose up
```

While in development, you can:

- Generate Prisma types for `@prisma/client` with `nr prisma:generate` (it runs `prisma generate`)
- Check generated Prisma documentation with `nr docs:prisma` (it runs `prisma-docs-generator serve`) then open <http://localhost:5858>
- Visualize the schema with [Prisma Editor](https://github.com/mohammed-bahumaish/prisma-editor) or [Prismaliser](https://prismaliser.app)
- Push Prisma schema changes for PlanetScale with `nr prisma:push` (it runs `prisma db push`)
  - You might notice that with [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/docs/tutorials/prisma-quickstart) approach with [Prisma](https://prisma.io/docs/guides/database/using-prisma-with-planetscale), we don't need migration files in our repo, rather managed in their platform.

### Run Development Server

Make sure you've generated the latest Prisma schema with `nr prisma:generate`.

Afterward, start the Remix development server like so based on your preference:

- Run without HMR: `nr dev`
- Run with HMR: `nr dev-hmr`

Without HMR, it will just run `remix dev`, the Remix server on development. Then wait until you see this:

```sh
Loading environment variables from .env
Remix App Server started at http://localhost:3000
```

Open up <http://localhost:3000> and you should be ready to go!

With HMR, it will run both `dev:remix` and `dev:express`, the Remix server and Express server with HMR enabled. Then wait until you see this:

```sh
üìÄ Remix on Express server port :3000
Loading environment variables from .env
üíø Built in 0s
```

Open up <http://localhost:3000> and you should be ready to go!
